# Task 1 - Intro to assertions

Mocha is our test framework of choice. It allows you to test synchronous or
asynchronous javascript using nodejs or in your browser.

Chai is an assertion library which allows your tests to follow more of a natural
language to make tests more readable.

This exercise will get you familiar with both of these.

For this exercise you will need to write tests for a basic library. To do this
you will need to check out the syntax for mocha and chai.
