# Task 5 - React

For testing react components we use Enzyme, an open source module from airbnb.

You can use this to render a component which allows you to run tets against it.
For example you may want to render the compenent with certain props and assert
that the markup looks as expected.

You can also use Enzyme to simulate events on your component such as link clicks
which you can then use to assert that the outcome was as expected.
