# Automated Testing Workshop

This is an automated testing workshop to go through the basics of how to write
automated tests with the libraries we use.

The project is split into separate tasks which should start off with the basics
and then go on to more complex testing practices.

Tasks:
 * [Introduction to assertions](./tasks/01-intro-to-assertions/README.md)
 * [Asynchronous code](./tasks/02-asynchronous-code/README.md)
 * [Spies](./tasks/03-spies/README.md)
 * [Stubs](./tasks/04-stubs/README.md)
 * [React](./tasks/05-react/README.md)
 * [Nightwatch](./tasks/06-nightwatch/README.md)
